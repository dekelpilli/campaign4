- Offer players more information before choosing divinity path
- Simplify tarot crafting to make it take less time
- Come up with some DSL for upgrading mods to make this more automatic
- Curios:
  - Some tags are extremely rare on armours, others extremely rare on weapons. This makes curios pretty bad for these tags on these items.
  - Keep inversed curios the same, make positive ones increase tiers instead of commonness? Combination of tiers and commonness?
    - Tier upgrading has same problems as artifacts did? Too closely competing with relics/tarot relics especially?
  - Make weighting bonus different for weapons and armours?
  - Allow curio-crafted items to ignore base restrictions?
  - Add curio-only enchants and rework curios to focus on these more?
  - Only have inversed curios?
  - Remove damage and survivability curios?
Talismans:
  - Consider out of combat triggering?
