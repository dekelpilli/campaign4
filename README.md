# Loot Rules

### Amulets
- Amulets contain a random trait from a random monster from a given CR.
- As a free action at any time, once per long rest, you can activate the trait contained by the amulet for a duration, granting you its effects.
- The duration of amulet effects is a number of rounds equal to the amulet CR (not monster CR), to a minimum of 1.
- Upgrading: Feed an amulet other amulets totalling at least its current CR capacity + 1 to get +1 CR tier.
- When upgrading amulets, or rerolling with crafting items, you may choose to keep the existing effect instead of the new one.
- The trait is standardised to not be tied to the creature or its specific actions/items. For example, "If the derro hits a target within 30 feet of it with a ranged attack with its aklys, it can use its bonus action to retrieve the aklys and make another attack against the same target" -> "If you hit a target within 30 feet of you with a ranged attack, you can use your bonus action to make another attack against the same target"
- The DCs of any effects granted by amulets are as listed, rather than standardised to the player's attributes.

### Divine Dust
You can use divinity dust to progress your progress in a divinity path you have started, or start a new one if you haven't started one/have finished all you have started.

### Moving mods
- Can move mod groups between any items so long as all mods are compatible with new item.
- Incompatible mods can be removed as part of a transfer.

### Enchant rules
- The same mod can't grant damage multiples times to the same instance of damage (e.g. "+2 fire and cold damage" will still only apply once to an attack that has both cold and fire).
- Die size increases increase the size of a single die (2d6 -> 1d6 + 1d8, 8d6 -> 5d6 + 1d8).

### Rings
- Max number of ring points used = char level + prof bonus
- Sacrifice: Smash n rings together (n > 1) to get a choice of 1 from n unique new rings that can't be of the same type as any of the inputs.
- Synergy rings = rings whose name starts with "The" = rings whose modifier interacts with other rings.

### Uniques
- Unique items are, lore-wise, failed attempts creating relics, or at replicating items from myths/folk stories
- Uniques on 2H weapons still only take up one enchantment slot
- Uniques cannot be moved to other gear slots, but can be moved within the slot + restriction

### Relics
- Relics related to a specific personality are unlocked at a certain quest state.
- Last relic level (10) is a choice:
  - New random mod from list of mods available on relic (rolled before choosing this option)
  - Upgrade existing mod of choice
  - New random mod (rolled before choosing this option)
- Characters have one armour relic slot, and one weapon relic slot. Any relic they put on will automatically get levelled to that level, but those levels are static once defined
- Characters can level up their relic slots (separately) at the following costs:
  1. 0 (start),
  2. 40,
  3. 60,
  4. 80,
  5. 110,
  6. 140,
  7. 170,
  8. 200,
  9. 250,
  10. 300

### Helmets
- Character enchants only, spawn with 20 points of mods
- Can be destroyed for 2 orbs of personality, regardless of mods
- Orb of personality:
  - Applying orb of personality either adds a new character mod or upgrades existing mod (or progresses an upgrade)
  - After applying upgrade, if mod upgrade is not in progress, has chance to fracture (make unmodifiable) based on point value on the helmet
- Players can attempt to mend a fractured helmet:
  - Each mod has 40% chance to stay the same, 30% to upgrade (to the next level), 30% chance to remove the mod completely
  - Only character enchants are affected by this (non-char enchants can be added on creation via tarot cards)

### Tarot
- Players may turn in tarot sets with 5 or 6 cards, unless specified otherwise.
- Unless specified otherwise, the base result of a tarot turn in is a 20 point magic item on a random base.
- Minimum enchant tags add random enchants from the general pool until the minimum is met.
- Uniques/relics forced to roll on a specific base type will reroll until a compatible unique/relic is rolled.
- Players draw 3 cards per loot result.

### Tags
- Drawbacks/negative mods have no tags
- The following tags exist:
  - Damage: Directly increases or grants damage (such as with an aura or thorns), either with flat additions or modifiers to the damage itself, ignore res/imm, minion damage, damage conversion
  - Critical: Inflicts staggered, reduces crit req, improves crit damage (e.g. via adding crit dice), triggers effect on crit
  - Accuracy: Grants AB, grants attacks advantage, grants enemies disadvantaged defence (dazed, staggered, blinded, restrained), grants DCs bonuses, lower enemy AC/saves
  - Survivability: Grants AC, spell save bonuses/adv, advantaged defence, health regen, incoming healing, max HP, minion defences, change incoming damage, barrier
  - Control: On enemies; Inflicts dazed/debilitated/frightened/rattled/slowed/sluggish/taunted/charmed/blinded/restrained/grappled, reduces speed, reduces accuracy, reduces damage, reduces attacks/actions
  - Magic: Grants bonuses to spell slots, concentration, spell levels, spells known, non-accuracy/damage buffs to spell behaviour
  - Wealth: Grants bonuses to loot found, sell value, improves loot searches directly (+investigation doesn't count), improves journey activities
  - Utility: Grants other bonuses such as skill proficiencies/bonuses, languages, senses, speed, class points

### Journey Activities & Travel
- Which journey activity is performed is decided at the start of the day by each player, after learning the weather
- If players short rest during a day they perform journey activities, half a day of travel is added, even if they short rest more than once
- Journey activity DCs are increased by 1 for each short rest already performed that day

### Barrier
- Whenever you take damage, if it matches a barrier you have, it depletes the barrier before depleting your hit points. If it matches multiple barriers, you can choose which barrier is depleted first.
- Your barrier values are set to their maximums at the end of your turn and when you roll for initiative.
- Whenever you gain/lose maximum barrier, you gain/lose an equal amount of barrier (min 0).
