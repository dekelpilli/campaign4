# Loot Rules

### Amulets
- Amulets contain a random trait from a random monster from a given CR.
- As a free action at any time, once per long rest, you can activate the trait contained by the amulet for a duration, granting you its effects.
- The duration of amulet effects is a number of rounds equal to the amulet CR (not monster CR), to a minimum of 1.
- Upgrading: Feed an amulet other amulets totalling at least its current CR capacity + 1 to get +1 CR tier.
- When upgrading amulets, or rerolling with crafting items, you may choose to keep the existing effect instead of the new one.
- The trait is standardised to not be tied to the creature or its specific actions/items. For example, "If the derro hits a target within 30 feet of it with a ranged attack with its aklys, it can use its bonus action to retrieve the aklys and make another attack against the same target" -> "If you hit a target within 30 feet of you with a ranged attack, you can use your bonus action to make another attack against the same target"
- The DCs of any effects granted by amulets are as listed, rather than standardised to the player's attributes.

### Divine Dust
You can use divinity dust to progress your progress in a divinity path you have started, or start a new one if you haven't started one/have finished all you have started.

### Receptacles
- Receptacles are vessels for holding enchantments that fit on one enchantment slot. This can be a relic (levelled or unlevelled), unique (levelled or unlevelled), or regular magic enchantment slot (any number of enchants).
- Receptacles can inherently swap the enchantments they hold with those on a compatible item.

### Moving mods
Can only move mods on weapons to weapons, and mods on armours to armours. Receptacles are untyped and can hold mods from any item.

### Enchant rules
- The same mod can't grant damage multiples times to the same instance of damage (e.g. "+2 fire and cold damage" will still only apply once to an attack that has both cold and fire).
- Die size increases increase the size of a single die (2d6 -> 1d6 + 1d8, 8d6 -> 5d6 + 1d8).

### Rings
- Max number of ring points used = char level + prof bonus
- Sacrifice: Smash n rings together (n > 1) to get a choice of 1 from n unique new rings that can't be of the same type as any of the inputs.
- Synergy rings = rings whose name starts with "The" = rings whose modifier interacts with other rings.

### Uniques
- Unique items are, lore-wise, failed attempts creating relics, or at replicating items from myths/folk stories
- Unique items/receptacle can be fed into another unique item of the same type (name), to increase that unique item's level
- Unique receptacles can be smashed into each other to generate a new unique item receptacle. The resulting item cannot be of the same type as the generated ones.

### Relics
Relics are equipment that can be levelled up with gold. Each relic starts at level 1, and can be levelled up 5 times (up to level 6). Each level costs 100gp. Whenever a relic is levelled up, the owner has 3 options of how to upgrade it, or can choose to apply none of the upgrades. Upgrades can either be to upgrade an existing affix on the relic, add a new random affix to the relic, or add a new thematic affix to the relic (each relic has its own set of thematic affixes). Any relic can be taken to a Diviner in any city to learn (for free) the options for the first two levels the relic will gain, and all the thematic affixes the relic has. When relics are sold, all gold invested in them will be refunded 100%.

### Vials
- Vials are consumable items that alter the behaviour of modifiers on your items. These can either be drunk to apply an effect on you, or applied to an item's modifiers to alter their behaviour.
- Vials applied to items also alter mods added after the vial was applied.
- A vial not drunk only impacts one enchantment slot. That is, a two-handed weapon has two separate slots where vials can be applied separately.
- There is no limit to the number of vials on an item/player, and vials apply in any order the player chooses.
- Vials on a player are calculated after vials on items.

### Helmets
- Character enchants only, spawn with 20 points of mods
- Can be destroyed for 2 orbs of personality, regardless of mods
- Orb of personality:
  - Applying orb of personality either adds a new character mod or upgrades existing mod (or progresses an upgrade)
  - After applying upgrade, if mod upgrade is not in progress, has chance to fracture (make unmodifiable) based on point value on the helmet
- Players can attempt to mend a fractured helmet:
  - Each mod has 40% chance to stay the same, 30% to upgrade (to the next level), 30% chance to remove the mod completely
  - Only character enchants are affected by this (non-char enchants can be added on creation via tarot cards)

### Tarot
- Players may turn in tarot sets with 5 or 6 cards, unless specified otherwise.
- Unless specified otherwise, the base result of a tarot turn in is a 20 point magic item on a random base.
- Minimum enchant tags add random enchants from the general pool until the minimum is met.
- Uniques/relics forced to roll on a specific base type will reroll until a compatible unique/relic is rolled.
- Players draw 3 cards per loot result.

  - Wealth: Grants bonuses to loot found, sell value, improves loot searches directly (+investigation doesn't count), improves journey activities
  - Utility: Grants other bonuses such as skill proficiencies/bonuses, languages, senses, speed, class points

### Journey Activities & Travel
- Which journey activity is performed is decided at the start of the day by each player, after learning the weather
- If players short rest during a day they perform journey activities, half a day of travel is added, even if they short rest more than once
- Journey activity DCs are increased by 1 for each short rest already performed that day

### Barrier
- Whenever you take damage, if it matches a barrier you have, it depletes the barrier before depleting your hit points. If it matches multiple barriers, you can choose which barrier is depleted first.
- Your barrier values are set to their maximums at the end of your turn and when you roll for initiative.
- Whenever you gain/lose maximum barrier, you gain/lose an equal amount of barrier (min 0).
